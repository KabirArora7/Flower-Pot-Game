Home Garden
Home Garden is a game designed to detect Parkinson's disease at an early stage, combining entertainment with a meaningful purpose. Inspired by the challenges of early diagnosis, this project aims to merge the world of gaming with impactful health solutions.

Key Features
Early Detection: The game tests motor skills and cognitive functions, translating early symptoms of Parkinson's disease into detectable patterns.
Engaging Gameplay: Players engage in various garden-related activities, subtly designed to monitor and assess their motor and cognitive abilities.
Collaborative Effort: Developed in collaboration with medical professionals to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the diagnostic elements.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed to be enjoyable and accessible for users of all ages, making it easy to participate and benefit from the game.
Inspiration
The idea for Home Garden was sparked by the importance of early intervention in managing Parkinson's disease. By integrating diagnostic tools into a fun and engaging game, we hope to make early detection more accessible and less intimidating.

How It Works
Players navigate through different levels of the game, performing tasks that test their motor skills and cognitive functions. The game collects data on these activities and analyzes it to detect patterns that may indicate early symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
